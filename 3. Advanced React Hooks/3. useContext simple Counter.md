In React you can use the built-in `context` to share a piece of state used by many components, this can save us from the problem we can face with [prop-drilling](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/prop-drilling).

In order to make use of the `context` you first have to **create** one and then you have to **provide** the values that it holds. 

Making the last line into code when you use `context` you'll mostly create something like this:

```js
// Create the context
const FooContext = React.createContext()

function FooDisplay() {
	// Use the value stored in the specific context
	const foo = React.useContext(FooContext)
	return <div>Foo is: {foo}</div>
}

ReactDOM.render(
	// Use the Provider to make available the value
  	<FooContext.Provider value="I am foo">
    	<FooDisplay />
  	</FooContext.Provider>,
  	document.getElementById('root'),
)
```

# Exercise
The base exercise is pretty simple, basically you have to follow the previous code and change a little bit in order to create a `context` that is able to keep the state of a counter.

Beside that we discovered that we can create the `Provider` as a custom component, this makes easier to handle it's state.

```js
function CountProvider(props){
	// Leverage useState to handle updates
	const [ count, setCount ] = React.useState(0);
	// Making a single array since we need to pass a single variable as value
	const value = [ count, setCount ];
	
	return (
		// I am spreading also all the props so also the children will be taken care of
		<CountContext.Provider value={value} {...props} />
	);
}
```

Once you structure the provider in this way you can get the value and the function in charge to update the state [[destructuring]] the array that we get with the [[useContext]] hook:

```js
// Retrieve just the value
const [count] = React.useContext(CountContext);
// Retrieve just the updater function
const [, setCount] = React.useContext(CountContext);
// Retrieve both destructuring
const [count, setCount] = React.useContext(CountContext);
// Just get all the value stored in context
const value = React.useContext(CountContext);
```

## Extra credit
### 1. 💯 create a consumer hook
In this exercise we want to create a [[custom Hook]] that will help us retrieve the values stored in our `context` and at the same time show an useful error message in case the user that is using our custom Hook is calling it without the proper `Provider` applied.

```js
// This is our new custom Hook
const [count, setCount] = useCount()
```
We are creating a custom Hook because we want to make our code as reusable as possible because without it we had to check the presence of the `Provider` in each component that uses that `context`.
```js
// My custom Hook that can be saved wherever we want
function useCount(){
	const context = React.useContext(CountContext);

	if( !context ){
		throw new Error('useCount must be used within the CountContext');
	}

	return context;
}
```

### 2. 💯 caching in a context provider
Now we have an example half made, the Pokemon search one. Our scope for the exercise is to put in the `context` the cache that has already prepared so we can use it in two different components at the same time.

Since this exercise does not present anything new, we just move the [[React.useReducer()|useReducer]] inside the `Provider` I am just going to skip it. If you want you can check the code and the video for a full explanation.
